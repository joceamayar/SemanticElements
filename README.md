# SemanticElements

## Description

Semantic elements in HTML are those that clearly describe their meaning both to the browser and to the developer. They are essentially HTML tags that provide information about the type of content they contain, making the web page more accessible and improving search engine optimization (SEO). Examples of semantic elements include:

1. **`<header>`**: This element represents the header of a section or a webpage, often containing introductory content or navigation links.
2. **`<footer>`**: The footer element typically contains authorship information, copyright notices, contact information, and links to terms of service.
3. **`<article>`**: This element is used for self-contained content that could be distributed independently, like blog posts, news articles, or forum posts.
4. **`<section>`**: A section element defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
5. **`<nav>`**: This element is intended for major blocks of navigation links.
6. **`<aside>`**: Represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content, often used for sidebars.
7. **`<figure>`** and **`<figcaption>`**: `figure` is for self-contained content, often with an optional caption (`figcaption`), and is typically referenced as a single unit.
